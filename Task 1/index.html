        Good Morning, I am <b>Vaishnavi Nagnath Chaudhari</b>. I was born and brought up in Latur.
        I have recently completed my <b>BTech in Information Technology</b> from 
        <b>M.S Bidve Engineering College, Latur</b>.
        I enjoy building practical applications using <b>Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL</b>.
        During my academics, I’ve worked on both frontend and backend modules — designing responsive UI, 
        writing clean backend logic, and integrating everything with a database.

        Some of my projects include an <b>Employee Management System</b> and a 
        <b>Banking System</b>, where I mainly contributed to backend development 
        and database design.

        I am passionate about learning new technologies, solving problems, and writing efficient code. 

        My hobbies are <b>painting, sketching</b>, and <b>playing badminton</b>.

        <!--Thank you for the opportunity to introduce myself.-->
